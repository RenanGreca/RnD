We are Renan ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Debo ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, two PhD students in Computer Science living in L'Aquila, Italy. Our bond is built around two primary passions, food and travel, which we wish to share with the world. Thus, RnD: Renan & Debo, Research & Development, Refreshments & Directions.

This blog is where we will narrate some of our adventures around the world, also giving suggestions about where to go and what to eat there. Sometimes we will also sprinkle in thoughts from our other interests when relevant, such as science, music, photography, film, video games and books.
